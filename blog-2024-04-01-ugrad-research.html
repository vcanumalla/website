<h1>Undergraduate Research</h1>
<p>Recently, especially approaching graduation as a senior undergraduate,
I’ve seen a good amount of people, from freshmen to seniors ask about how to get involved
in undergraduate research. I think this is great! I was very lucky to have 
my brother Ani Canumalla give me critical advice which I used to make
my experience as an undergraduate researcher productive.</p>
<p>I’ll try to outline a few key points that I think are broadly applicable,
as well as relevant anecdotes as an undergrad in the amazing UW PLSE lab.
I would say roughly this advice is probably relevant to the following groups</p>
<ol>
<li>
You’re an undergraduate looking to get involved in research at the UW PLSE lab with Zach (most relevant).
</li>
<li>
You’re an undergraduate looking to get involved in research at PLSE, but not necessarily with Zach (still strongly relevant).
</li>
<li>
You’re an undergraduate looking to get involved in research in general at UW CSE (fairly relevant).
</li>
</ol>
<p>Feel free to listen to as much or as little
of this advice as you’d like, and I hope it helps you in your journey!</p>
<p><em>These notes are a work in progress</em></p>
<section id="Start-Early">
<h3>Start Early</h3>
<p>Start early. Earlier than you think. As early as you can.</p>
<p>I think many undergraduates, me included, have a tendency to think that you have to be capable of
doing flawless PhD-level research before you even
think about asking labs or professors about research opportunities. This is not true.</p>
<p><strong><strong>You are <em>supposed</em> to be inexperienced and bad
at research in the beginning<a id="fnref1" href="#fn1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>.</strong></strong></p>
<section id="Why">
<h4>Why?</h4>
<p>Starting research early has several strong benefits:
1. Research takes a long time to see concrete
results. Starting early gives you time to
onboard onto a project, write a paper with your team,
and see it through to publication. Seeing the fruits of your labor is a hugely rewarding experience! 
2. Starting early helps you get exposed to the tasks that a researcher does in all stages of a project’s lifecycle. This is especially useful if you might be considering graduate school, and
want concrete experience to know if it will be a 
good personal fit for you.
3. Starting early gives you time to build relationships with your labmates and professors.
This is important <strong><strong>regardless</strong></strong> of whether you
want to graduate school. These relationships can
lead to internships and job opportunities that
are not available to the average undergraduate.</p>
</section>
<section id="How">
<h4>How?</h4>
<p>After finishing your first or second year at UW,
I would recommend reaching out to professors or labs based on your interests. That being said,
I don’t think the project you work on is as
important as the people you work with, which
we will get to later. Apply to groups that
have good culture—PLSE is great, I have
additionally heard great things about the Syslab
and the Security and Privacy Research Lab at UW,
but there are also others. Some good proxies to look for to see if a lab has a good culture are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Undergrads get time to meet with professors occasionally (quarterly would be great).
</li>
<li>
The ratio between undergrads to grad students are reasonable: its unlikely you’ll get much attention if each PhD student “mentors” 12 undergrads.
</li>
<li>
Undergrad alumni from the lab have gone to
strong PhD programs or industry positions.
</li>
<li>
Your friends or people you’ve talked to
have had good experiences in the lab.
</li>
</ol>
<p>This list is not exhaustive, but its a good starting point.</p>

<section id="My-Experience">
<h4>My Experience</h4>
<p>I started research in the spring of
my freshman year. I had taken a programming languages course that I found interesting, but notably didn’t get an A in (You don’t have to be perfect!), and asked the amazing Zach Tatlock if he had open research opportunities at PLSE. I really enjoyed Zach’s energy and personality, which was why I was drawn to working with him.</p>
<p>He said no, but to ask other PhD students and faculty in the group. Looking at his students, I emailed Gus to work on his project and after 6 months of closely working with Gus <a id="fnref2" href="#fn2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, 
I started
meeting with Zach regularly during project meetings.</p>
<p>I think the most important thing I did was have persistence. Even though Zach said no, I still asked other people in the lab, and eventually Zach had to accept I wasn’t going away. I wouldn’t necessarily recommend that approach, but I do think being persistent by hanging around the lab or reading groups and getting to
know the people there for an extended period of
time is very impactful.</p>
<p>PLSE in particular has
the first-rate PL and SE reading groups (PLRG
and SERG) that are fantastic places to meet
people and learn how to read academic papers.
Other labs almost certainly have similar groups.</p>

<section id="Don't-spread-yourself-too-thin">
<h3>Don’t spread yourself too thin</h3>
<p>This is perhaps <strong><strong>the most important</strong></strong> piece 
of advice that I can give. The single 
biggest killer of research productivity in
your undergraduate will be other obligations.</p>
<section id="Why-1">
<h4>Why?</h4>
<p>At a top school like UW, you will have a lot of
pressure from your peers and yourself to 
“grind” and take on as many opportunities as
possible. This is a good thing! But if you don’t control yourself, you will quickly find 
that research is the first thing to suffer (atleast in my experience).</p>
</section>
<section id="How-1">
<h4>How?</h4>
<p>My advice isn’t something anyone likes to hear, 
but you’ll have to take some time to figure 
out what are you biggest priorities, and 
cut out commitments accordingly. This will be different for everyone, but I think it’s important to be honest with yourself about what you can handle <strong>while not going insane</strong>.</p>
<p>I think generally from what I’ve seen, the 
best way to get time back is to reduce
courseload as much as possible. I suggest
maximum 2 technical courses per quarter if you
want to do great research, but this will vary
from person to person. I personally usually
go for only one because I’m lazy.</p>
</section>
<section id="My-Experience-1">
<h4>My Experience</h4>
<p>I think following this advice was the single
biggest factor in my success as a research
assistant. For me, research was my top priority and my most interesting academic activity. 
I took light course loads the vast majority of the time, and the quarters I did not, I was not able to make significant progress on my research.</p>
<p>In spring quarter of 2023, we were pushing for a
deadline on Lakeroad, and I was taking 
CSE 452, a notoriously time-consuming course along
with a graduate special topics course on ML systems.</p>
<p>I found that I was really struggling to balance
my mental and physical health while 
pushing on the Lakeroad deadline, 
and was falling behind on my project
for the ML systems course. I ended up dropping
the course, which helped me maintain sanity
and have much-needed relaxation time during a busy deadline period<a id="fnref3" href="#fn3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
<p>I also sacrificed several TA opportunities in
order to have more time for research. I don’t
regret my decision, but I do know that I
would have really enjoyed TAing. Unfortunately
I had to make a choice to achieve the
research goals I had set for myself.</p>
<p>It is a personal decision how you want to split your time. One choice is not better than the other. I know undergraduates who did a small
amount of research and TA’d regularly, and they
are immensely successful. Just be sure to 
be conscious about the choices you make, and
whether they are helping you achieve your 
personal goals.</p>

<section id="What-you-work-on-matters-less-than-who-you-work-with">
<h3>What you work on matters less than who you work with</h3>
<p>I’ve noticed a lot of undergraduates spend a lot of time
agonizing over finding research with a faculty or PhD
student who does <em>exactly</em> their interests. In general,
I would say this is slightly backwards: you should seek 
out people you think will be good mentors rather than
people who match exactly your research interests.</p>
<section id="Why-2">
<h4>Why?</h4>
<p>There are several reasons this makes sense strategically.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Research will <em>always</em> look fundamentally different
to the corresponding classes you have taken and have 
an interest in. Courses, especially undergraduate
courses, teach the <em>foundations</em> of a topic, not the
current forefront. You might not see the immediate
relations between the content in your favorite courses
and the research papers faculty in that area are writing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You (most likely) don’t have a research vision that
you should be set on pursuing immediately. You’ll learn
how to develop a research agenda you are passionate
about by doing research, not before you start.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many topics become extremely interesting once you
get over a small basic knowledge hump. Something 
that doesn’t sound interesting at first glance might
be very enticing once you spend a week or two learning
about it from a PhD student who’s job is to share their
enthusiasm for the research.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Research becomes more fun the more you mature (in my opinion).
A good mentor will help you mature quicker, while a bad
or absentee mentor will stunt your growth significantly.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section id="How-2">
<h4>How?</h4>
<p>The advice here is simple. See above for looking for good group cultures,
but you should put your research interests as a second priority.
Talk to other undergraduates about their experiences with
their mentor, and see whether the strengths and weaknesses of
the mentor would complement your own skillset. You should
also talk to the potential mentor yourself and get a vibe-check. Your 
gut can tell you than you know.</p>
<p>Finally, research interests are a second priority, but still a priority.
I want to encourage you to be <em>open</em> to learning new topics, 
not to subject yourself to research you fundamentally don’t click with. 
If you vomit and have panic attacks at the mention of compilers or
operational semantics, don’t force yourself to work in the PL group just because
people have said good things about PLSE.</p>

<section id="Conclusion">
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>I think this advice is a good way to get started
in research. I might expand on this in the future,
but I think this is the most important advice in regards to getting started in research.</p>
