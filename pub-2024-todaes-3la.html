<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Ideally, accelerator development should be as easy as software development. 
Several recent design languages/tools are working toward this goal, 
but actually testing early designs on real applications end-to-end 
remains prohibitively difficult due to the costs of building 
specialized compiler and simulator support. We propose a 
new first-in-class, mostly automated methodology termed “3LA” 
to enable end-to-end testing of prototype accelerator designs on 
unmodified source applications. A key contribution of 3LA is the 
use of a formal software/hardware interface that specifies an 
accelerator’s operations and their semantics. Specifically, we 
leverage the Instruction-level Abstraction (ILA) formal 
specification for accelerators that has been successfully used 
thus far for accelerator implementation verification. We show how the 
ILA for accelerators serves as a software/hardware interface, similar 
to the Instruction Set Architecture for processors, that can be used 
for automated development of compilers and instruction-level simulators. 
Another key contribution of this work is to show how ILA-based accelerator 
semantics enables extending recent work on equality saturation to 
auto-generate basic compiler support for prototype accelerators 
in a technique we term “flexible matching.” By combining 
flexible matching with simulators auto-generated from ILA
specifications, our approach enables end-to-end evaluation 
with modest engineering effort. We detail several case studies 
of 3LA, which uncovered an unknown flaw in a recently published 
accelerator and facilitated its fix.</p>
