## Abstract

FPGA technology mapping is
  the process of implementing 
  a hardware design expressed 
  in high-level HDL 
  (hardware design language) 
  code using the low-level, 
  architecture-specific 
  primitives of the target 
  FPGA. 
As FPGAs become 
  increasingly heterogeneous, 
  achieving high performance 
  requires hardware synthesis 
  tools that better support 
  mapping to complex, highly 
  configurable primitives 
  like digital signal 
  processors (DSPs). 
Current tools support DSP 
  mapping via handwritten 
  special-case mapping rules, 
  which are laborious to write, 
  error-prone, and often 
  overlook mapping opportunities. 
We introduce Lakeroad, a 
  principled approach to 
  technology mapping via 
  sketch-guided program 
  synthesis. 
Lakeroad leverages two 
  techniques---architecture-independent 
  sketch templates and semantics 
  extraction from HDL---to 
  provide extensible technology 
  mapping with stronger correctness 
  guarantees and higher coverage of 
  mapping opportunities than state-of-the-art
  tools. 
Across representative 
  microbenchmarks, Lakeroad produces 
  2--3.5√ó the number of optimal 
  mappings compared to proprietary 
  state-of-the-art tools and 6--44√ó 
  the number of optimal mappings 
  compared to popular open-source tools, 
  while also providing correctness 
  guarantees not given by any other tool.
