# [Vishal Canumalla][]


I am a (incoming) PhD Student in Electrical Engineering
  at Stanford University.
Previously, I was an undergraduate
  at the University of Washington in the
  [PLSE][] group, where I studied
  programming languages and compilers.

  My research interests are in the intersection
    of programming languages and computer
    architecture. 
  I am particularly interested in using
    formal methods and compiler
    optimization techniques to improve the
    performance and efficiency of
    specialized hardware.
  Most recently I worked on using
    program synthesis in automating
    hardware compilation of FPGAs.

  At the University of Washington, I was
    very fortunate to be 
    advised by [Zachary Tatlock][] and
    [Gus Smith][]. 
  I've additionally interned in industry,
    at Certora working on mutation testing,
    and I'm currently at Adobe Research
    working on projects in the Halide
    compiler.
