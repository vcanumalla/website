_Last updated August 2025_

  I am a second year graduate student
    in electrical engineering at Stanford.
  Previously, I graduated from the Allen School
    at the University of Washington (UW CSE)
    where I studied computer science.
  
  My research interests are in the intersection
    of programming languages and computer
    architecture.
  Most recently I worked on using
    program synthesis in automating
    hardware compilation of FPGAs.
  At the University of Washington, I was
    very fortunate to be 
    advised by [Zachary Tatlock][] and
    [Gus Smith][]. 
  I've additionally interned in industry,
    under [Chandrakana Nandi][] at Certora,
    and under [Derek Gerstmann][] 
    at Adobe Research.
