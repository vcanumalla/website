<h1><a href="https://vcanumalla.github.io/">Vishal Canumalla</a> / About</h1>
<p>I was born in Dallas, but home to me will
always be the Pacific Northwest.
I’ve lived here since I was 6!</p>
<p>I used to want to study chemistry
in high school, before settling on
doing chemistry and computer science,
and then just computer science.</p>
<p>My hobbies are mostly non-technical. 
I especially enjoy fantasy in any 
medium: games, books, movies, 
anything really. 
I also am an avid wildlife photographer. 
I find animals give far less criticism 
on their portraits than 
my human friends do.</p>
<p>I enjoy snowboarding (decent), 
tennis (mediocre), 
basketball (horrendous), 
and running (improving)!</p>
<p>I have an older brother Ani, 
who is a Ph.D. student at 
UCSD CSE. 
He’s much smarter than me, 
but I keep up by learning 
from his example.</p>
