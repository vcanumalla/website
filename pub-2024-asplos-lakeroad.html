<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>FPGA technology mapping is
the process of implementing 
a hardware design expressed 
in high-level HDL 
(hardware design language) 
code using the low-level, 
architecture-specific 
primitives of the target 
FPGA. 
As FPGAs become 
increasingly heterogeneous, 
achieving high performance 
requires hardware synthesis 
tools that better support 
mapping to complex, highly 
configurable primitives 
like digital signal 
processors (DSPs). 
Current tools support DSP 
mapping via handwritten 
special-case mapping rules, 
which are laborious to write, 
error-prone, and often 
overlook mapping opportunities. 
We introduce Lakeroad, a 
principled approach to 
technology mapping via 
sketch-guided program 
synthesis. 
Lakeroad leverages two 
techniques‚Äîarchitecture-independent 
sketch templates and semantics 
extraction from HDL‚Äîto 
provide extensible technology 
mapping with stronger correctness 
guarantees and higher coverage of 
mapping opportunities than state-of-the-art
tools. 
Across representative 
microbenchmarks, Lakeroad produces 
2‚Äì3.5√ó the number of optimal 
mappings compared to proprietary 
state-of-the-art tools and 6‚Äì44√ó 
the number of optimal mappings 
compared to popular open-source tools, 
while also providing correctness 
guarantees not given by any other tool.</p>
